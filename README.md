# FPGA Atari Project
  This is an implementation of the Atari breakout game that was implemented on a DE1-SoC FPGA development board. It was coded through the Verilog scripting language and provides users with a display as well as physical controls through the buttons and the switches on the board.
# Visual implementations
Display: 

Background: the dark blue baground gives a nice contrast to the other objects required for play allowing for a cleaner look.

Blocks: each row of blocks has a seaperate color from those surrounding them to better help the user distiquish progress through row destruction.

Paddle: the paddle is white so as to draw the users eye with its sharp contrast to the dark baground allowing the user to easily see where the paddle is at all times.

Ball: the ball is white to help indicate that the user can interact with it through the paddle as well as being an easy color to track visually.

Lose State: the baground shifts colors to red upon losing giving the user imeadiate feed back upon the fact that the game has concluded in a loss.
